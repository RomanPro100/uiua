## Open to Implementation

These features are not strictly on the roadmap, but PRs that implement them will likely be accepted.

Feel free to make PRs to the list itself as well.

- Better complex `⌈`/`⌊`/`⁅`/`◿`, `<`/`>`/`≤`/`≥`, `↥`/`↧`
- Pad link from Gist
- Additional optimizations
  - `/F◫`
  - `/F⇌`
  - `⍜⇌/F`
